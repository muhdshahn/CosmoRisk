## Simulation Accuracy Notice

This software ("CosmoRisk") is provided for **educational and research purposes only**. 
The simulation results, orbital predictions, and impact assessments are **approximations** 
based on simplified physical models and may not accurately represent real-world outcomes.

### Key Limitations

1. **Orbital Elements**: Asteroid orbital data from NASA NeoWs API may have uncertainties 
   ranging from meters to kilometers depending on observation history.

2. **Physics Model**: The simulation implements comprehensive orbital mechanics including:
   - N-body gravity with Moon perturbations for close Earth approaches
   - J2 oblateness perturbation
   - Solar Radiation Pressure
   - Yarkovsky thermal effect
   - Jupiter/Mars gravitational perturbations
   
   **However, it does not include:**
   - Non-gravitational outgassing
   - Binary asteroid interactions  
   - General relativistic effects (except simplified precession)
   - Precise thermal modeling

3. **MOID Calculation**: Uses 72×72 point orbital sampling for accuracy, but is not JPL-grade precision.

4. **Torino Scale**: Our energy-based Torino classification is a simplified model that:
   - Converts kinetic energy to Megatons TNT
   - Uses probability × energy thresholds
   - Does NOT replace official NASA Sentry or ESA NEOCC assessments

5. **Impact Predictions**: All "hazard" or "impact" assessments are **NOT** official NASA/ESA 
   determinations. For official assessments, consult:
   - [NASA Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS)](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/)
   - [ESA NEO Coordination Centre (NEOCC)](https://neo.ssa.esa.int/)
